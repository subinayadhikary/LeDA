As we mentioned in this paper, we considered on IPC 302 (Punishment for murder) and some similar IPCs such as IPC 299, IPC 300, IPC 307. Particularly we have considered section 299 to section 311 of IPC that is basically "of offences affteing the human body" and we have discussed all of them briefly. In Indian Penal Code (IPC), 511 sections are there and 23 chapters are there. Here we focused on Chapter XVI. <br/>
